# speaker-diarization

This project explores and evaluates **four distinct speaker diarization pipelines**, progressively building from basic heuristics to more structured clustering-based methods. The objective is to identify "who spoke when" from raw audio recordings in an unsupervised manner, balancing interpretability, robustness, and performance across different approaches.

## Approaches Implemented

### **Approach 1: Kruskal's Algorithm**
### **Approach 2: BIC-Based Sliding Window Analysis**
### **Approach 3: VAD-filtered BIC with Hierarchical Clustering**
### **Approach 4: Agglomerative Clustering and Statistical Analysis**
